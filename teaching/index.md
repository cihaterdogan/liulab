## Indiana Genomics Research Training Program for Data Scientists (INGEN4DS)

The [INGEN4DS](https://medicine.iu.edu/research-centers/computational-biology-bioinformatics/education/genomics-research-training) training program provides a mechanism for students currently enrolled in Indiana University masterâ€™s degree programs in data science to gain research experience and academic training in genomics during the second year of their degree programs. In this one-year fellowship, INGEN4DS scholars receive mentored hands-on exposure to genomics data sets and career development opportunities that prepares them to enter the genomics workforce, apply to PhD programs, or participate in genomics research.
This program is funded by an R25 training grant (5R25HG012325) from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), PI: Yunlong Liu and Kun Huang.
